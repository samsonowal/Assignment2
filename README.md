Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. 	Displays the result accordingly.
4. 	Input Collection and Conversion:

               x = int(input("Enter a Number: "))

    The user is prompted to enter a number.

    The input is converted from a string to an integer using int().

    Even or Odd Check:

              if x % 2 == 0:

    The program uses the modulus operator % to check if the number is divisible by 2.

    If the remainder is 0, the number is even.

    Conditional Output:

                  print(x, "is an even number.")

    If the number is even, it prints: x is an even number.

              else:
                  print(x, "is an odd number.")

    If the number is not divisible by 2, it prints: x is an odd number.
5. 	Output:
